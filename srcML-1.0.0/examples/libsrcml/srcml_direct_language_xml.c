/*
  Example program of the use of the C API for srcML.

  A straightforward translation from the srcML format back to source code.
  Translates the srcML file "a.cpp.xml" to the source-code file "a.cpp", however
  in this case the language is specified:

  * This creates a single-unit srcML file, i.e., a non-archive srcML
  * The srcML attribute filename will be the name of the file passed as the first
  parameter.
